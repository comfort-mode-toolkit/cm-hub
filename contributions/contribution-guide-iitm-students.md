# Contribution Guide for IIT Madras Students

Welcome to the Comfort Mode ecosystem! This guide is for students and researchers from IIT Madras interested in contributing to a new vision for web accessibility, as described in ["Beyond Compliance: A User-Autonomy Framework for Inclusive and Customizable Web Accessibility"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.10324).
> **Disclaimer:**  
> This guide is an independent, community-created resource for IIT Madras students interested in the Comfort Mode project. It is not officially endorsed by IIT Madras or any of its departments. Its purpose is to help students and contributors get involved, learn, and make a positive impact. Everyone is welcome‚Äîyour ideas and energy make this community stronger!

## What is the Comfort Mode Ecosystem?

**Comfort Mode** is a community-driven accessibility platform that lets web users customize their digital experience‚Äîcolors, fonts, motion, and more‚Äîbased on their own needs, not just a fixed "accessible" standard. Inspired by and grateful for the foundational work of WCAG, accessibility researchers, and practitioners, we aim to go further:  
**Can we build a web that truly puts users in control of their own comfort and needs?**

**The Vision:**  
Move beyond basic compliance. Make the web a place where each person‚Äîregardless of ability‚Äîcan tailor their experience for real comfort, ease, and inclusion.

## Project Foundation

Built upon the shoulders of giants, including:
- The [W3C WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards
- Research and advocacy from accessibility experts worldwide
- The [Beyond Compliance](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.10324) paper, which proposes a user-autonomy model for web accessibility

## How Does Comfort Mode Work? (WIP)

- **cm-core** is a Python command-line tool that lets developers configure accessibility settings in a few steps.
- It generates and overrides CSS custom properties and class names to instantly adapt websites for user comfort.
- It outputs a cm-`comp.html` component of a toggle to copy paste into their code ( either on navbar or somewhere persistent ), a `cm-vars.css` which is basically a override file of the variables in original css, a `cm-toggle.js` which just adds or removes the class from `<body>` tag to toggle between normal and comfort mode - Think light dark theme toggles in websites
- The system is modular: anyone can extend it with new plugins for colors, typography, motion, and more‚Äîmaking the web ever more accessible.
- Comfort Mode does **not** require changing your website‚Äôs structure. All changes are layered on top, making it easy and safe to adopt.

Developers simply add our core component and get a comfort toggle‚Äîthink cookie consent banners, but for personalizing accessibility.

**Developers customize based on their user base:**

## FAQ

### Do I need to know how to code?

**No!** There are many ways to contribute beyond coding. See ‚ÄúNon-code contributions‚Äù below.

### I only know core Python. Is that okay?

**Absolutely.** Many beginner-friendly tasks use only basic Python. See ‚ÄúPython tasks‚Äù below for examples.

### What if I‚Äôm new to open source or accessibility?

That‚Äôs perfectly fine! We welcome newcomers and provide guidance. Start with documentation, research summaries, or beginner Python issues. Ask for help in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/comfort-mode/cm-hub/discussions).
