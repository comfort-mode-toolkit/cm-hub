# Research Best Practices Guide

Welcome, Comfort Mode researchers! This guide will help you carry out and document research that is clear, reliable, and valuable for the community—no matter your experience level.

---

## 1. Start with a Clear Question

- What are you trying to find out?
- Who will this help (users, developers, designers, etc.)?
- Try to state your question or hypothesis in a single sentence.

---

## 2. Gather Evidence

- **Use diverse sources:** Academic papers, user studies, blog posts, books, reputable websites.
- **Prioritize user-centered evidence:** Real user feedback, usability studies, accessibility reports.
- **Take notes:** Write down key findings, quotes, or numbers. Always record your sources!

---

## 3. Summarize and Compare

- Explain each model, approach, or solution simply.
- Compare strengths, weaknesses, and real-world usage.
- If multiple models exist, make a short table or list.

---

## 4. Make Recommendations

- Based on your findings, which approach/model seems best for our use case?
- Are there trade-offs or situations where one is better than another?
- Be honest if there’s no clear answer—summarizing uncertainty is valuable too!

---

## 5. Document Clearly

- Use the **Research Spec Template** below.
- Keep it beginner-friendly: avoid jargon, or explain it simply if you must use it.
- Use bullet points, tables, and short paragraphs.

---

## 6. Cite Your Sources

- List all references at the end (links, DOIs, titles, etc.).
- Give enough info for others to find the original.

---

## 7. Collaborate

- If you start work on a topic, comment on the relevant GitHub issue so others know.
- Share drafts early for feedback.
- Be open to questions and suggestions.

---

## 8. Always Be Respectful

- Acknowledge previous work and diverse perspectives.
- Credit all contributors.
- Remember: curiosity and effort matter more than expertise!
