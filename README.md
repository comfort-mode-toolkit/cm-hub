# Comfort Mode Hub üè†

> **The research and knowledge center for community-driven web accessibility**

Welcome to the central hub where web accessibility ideas turn into real tools that help people. This is where we discuss, research, and plan new accessibility features before they get built.

## What is Comfort Mode?

Comfort Mode is a framework that lets website users customize accessibility settings to their personal needs - colors, fonts, motion, and more - rather than accepting one-size-fits-all "accessible" designs.

**The Goal:** Give users control over their web experience while keeping websites beautiful.

## How to Get Involved

### üí° I have an idea for an accessibility feature
**Go to:** [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/comfort-mode/cm-hub/discussions)
- Share your idea in the "Ideas" category
- Describe who it would help and why
- Community will discuss and provide feedback

### üî¨ I want to help with research
**Go to:** [Research Projects](https://github.com/comfort-mode/cm-hub/projects/1)
- Check "Research Needed" column for active investigations
- Pick a topic that interests you
- Follow our research template to contribute findings

### üíª I want to write code
**Go to:** Implementation repositories based on what you want to build:
<!-- - **Colors/Contrast:** [@cm/colors repo](https://github.com/comfort-mode/cm-colors)
- **Fonts/Text:** [@cm/typography repo](https://github.com/comfort-mode/cm-typography)
- **Motion/Animation:** [@cm/motion repo](https://github.com/comfort-mode/cm-motion) -->
- **Main Tool:** [@cm/core repo](https://github.com/comfort-mode/cm-core)
[ Sub repos to be added ]

### üìö I want to help with documentation
<!-- **Go to:** [Documentation Issues](https://github.com/comfort-mode/cm-hub/labels/documentation)
- Find docs that need writing or updating
- Help make complex topics simple to understand
- Create tutorials and examples -->
[ To be added ]

### üß™ I want to help with testing
**Go to:** Any implementation repo's "Issues" tab
- Look for "testing-needed" label
- Help verify features work across different browsers
- Test with real accessibility tools

## How Ideas Become Real Features

### Step 1: Community Discussion
- Someone suggests an accessibility feature
- Community discusses: Is this needed? Who would it help?
- Moderators review for quality and feasibility

### Step 2: Research Phase
- Volunteers research the accessibility need
- Find academic papers, user studies, best practices
- Write a research summary using our template

### Step 3: Specification Creation
- Research gets turned into a technical specification
- Clear requirements: What exactly should be built?
- Technical approach: How should it work?

### Step 4: Moderation Review
- Moderators check specification for:
  - Quality of research
  - WCAG compliance
  - Technical feasibility
  - User value

### Step 5: Implementation
- Approved specs become issues in the right repository
- Developers build the feature following the specification
- Code gets reviewed and tested

### Step 6: Integration
- New features get integrated into @cm/core
- Documentation gets updated
- Users can start using the feature

## Our Quality Standards

### Research Must Be:
- **Evidence-based:** Backed by academic papers or user studies
- **Specific:** Clear about who it helps and how
- **Feasible:** Technically possible to implement
- **Valuable:** Addresses real user needs

### Code Must Be:
- **Tested:** Works across different browsers and devices
- **Documented:** Clear instructions for other developers
- **Accessible:** Follows WCAG guidelines
- **Maintainable:** Clean, readable code

### Features Must Be:
- **User-centered:** Solves actual user problems
- **Customizable:** Users can adjust to their needs
- **Non-intrusive:** Doesn't break existing designs
- **Performance-friendly:** No impact on website speed
