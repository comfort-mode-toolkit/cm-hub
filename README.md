# Comfort Mode Toolkit

**A simple, open-source toolkit for making websites more comfortable, personalized, and accessible—while letting brands keep their unique look and feel.**

---

## What is this project?

Comfort Mode Toolkit is a flexible JavaScript library and UI widget that works with any website or frontend framework. It lets users easily adjust things like contrast, font, motion, and scaling—helping everyone, especially neurodivergent and disabled users, make sites more comfortable for themselves.

This project builds on the ideas from  
[“Beyond Compliance: A User-Autonomy Framework for Inclusive and Customizable Web Accessibility”](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.10324).  
The paper suggests that accessibility should not be just about following rules, but about truly caring for users’ needs and dignity:

> “This paper argues for a reframing of accessibility not as mere compliance, but as a form of care, one that honors user autonomy and supports interface adaptation... design attentive to lived context, individual dignity, and relational needs, rather than compliance with abstract norms.”

Our goal is to help everyone shape their own web experience, while still letting brands express their personality and design.

## Key Features

- **User Autonomy:** Users decide what works best for them—no more one-size-fits-all.
- **Personalization:** Options for dyslexia-friendly fonts, reduced motion, higher contrast, larger text, and more.
- **Design Harmony:** Brands can keep their logo, colors, and style—Comfort Mode can be set up to protect your brand identity while improving accessibility for everyone.
- **Easy Integration:** Works as a drop-in widget or can be embedded in any website or app.
- **Inclusive & Ethical:** Inspired by care ethics, the toolkit puts dignity, comfort, and real user needs first—not just compliance checklists.

## How does it work?

1. Add the toolkit to your site.
2. Users open the widget and pick settings that make the website easier or more comfortable for them.
3. Their choices are remembered for future visits.
4. Brands and developers can pick which design elements always keep their original look, so your unique visual identity stays strong.
